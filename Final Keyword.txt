What is final keyword in Java?
	Final is a keyword or reserved word in java and can be applied to 
	member variables, methods, class and local variables in Java. Once you 
	make a reference final you are not allowed to change that reference 
	and compiler will verify this and raise compilation error if you try 
	to re-initialized final variables in java.
	

1. What is final variable in Java?
	Any variable either member variable or local variable (declared inside 
	method or block) modified by final keyword is called final variable. 
	Final variables are often declare with static keyword in java and treated 
	as constant. Here is an example of final variable in Java
	
		public static final String LOAN = "loan";
		LOAN = new String("loan") //invalid compilation error

	Final variables are by default read-only.
	

2. What is final method in Java?
	Final keyword in java can also be applied to methods. A java method with 
	final keyword is called final method and it can not be overridden in 
	sub-class. You should make a method final in java if you think itâ€™s complete 
	and its behavior should remain constant in sub-classes. Final methods are 
	faster than non-final methods because they are not required to be resolved 
	during run-time and they are bonded on compile time. Here is an example 
	of final method in Java:

	class PersonalLoan{
		public final String getName(){
			return "personal loan";
		}
	}

	class CheapPersonalLoan extends PersonalLoan{
		@Override
		public final String getName(){
			return "cheap personal loan"; //compilation error: overridden method is final
		}
	}

3. What is final Class in Java
	Java class with final modifier is called final class in Java. 
	Final class is complete in nature and can not be sub-classed or 
	inherited. Several classes in Java are final e.g. String, Integer 
	and other wrapper classes. Here is an example of final class in java
	
	final class PersonalLoan{

	}

	class CheapPersonalLoan extends PersonalLoan{  
		//compilation error: cannot inherit from final class
 	}


Benefits of final keyword in Java
	Here are few benefits or advantage of using final keyword in Java:
	1. Final keyword improves performance. Not just JVM can cache final 
	   variable but also application can cache frequently use final variables.
	2. Final variables are safe to share in multi-threading environment 
	   without additional synchronization overhead.
	3. Final keyword allows JVM to optimized method, variable or class.
